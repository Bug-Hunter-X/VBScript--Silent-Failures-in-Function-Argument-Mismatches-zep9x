Function calls with incorrect number of arguments are frequently overlooked in VBScript.  While VBScript doesn't always throw explicit errors for mismatched arguments, it often leads to unexpected behavior or incorrect results.  For instance, if a function expects two arguments but is called with one or three, it might silently use default values (if any), or use garbage values leading to subtle bugs that are difficult to track.
